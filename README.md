# Draughts
Draughts board game (aka checkers).

The code implements the "*International draughts*" variant (Dutch: "*dammen*").
> All values like board sizes, number of pieces, positions etc. are set by constants.
> No tests are provided or promises given on the proper functioning of the code when these values are changed.

### Notation
According to draughts conventions for the common "*International draughts*" variant,
the playable squares on a regular Draughts board are numbered 1 to 50 like shown in the diagram below.
> Note that only the dark colored squares can have a piece on it, and only those are numbered.
> The light colored squares are not assigned numbers.
